  <h1>The Nights</h1>
  <h2>By Avicii</h2>
  <p>
    Hey, once upon a younger year<br>
    When all our shadows disappeared<br>
    The animals inside came out to play<br>
    Hey, when face to face with all our fears<br>
    Learned our lessons through the tears<br>
    Made memories we knew would never fade<br>
  </p>
  <p>  
    One day my father—he told me,<br>
    "Son, don't let it slip away"<br>
    He took me in his arms, I heard him say,<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    "When you get older<br>
    Your wild life will live for younger days<br>
    Think of me if ever you're afraid."<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind<br>
    So live a life you will remember."<br>
    My father told me when I was just a child<br>
    These are the nights that never die<br>
    My father told me...<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    When thunder clouds start pouring down<br>
    Light a fire they can't put out<br>
    Carve your name into those shinning stars<br>
    He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores.<br>
    Don't forsake this life of yours.<br>
    I'll guide you home no matter where you are."<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    One day my father—he told me,<br>
    "Son, don't let it slip away."<br>
    When I was just a kid I heard him say,<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    "When you get older<br>
    Your wild life will live for younger days<br>
    Think of me if ever you're afraid."<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind<br>
    So live a life you will remember."<br>
    My father told me when I was just a child<br>
    These are the nights that never die<br>
    My father told me...<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    These are the nights that never die<br>
    My father told me...<br>
